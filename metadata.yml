# metadata.yaml for Reaver's Xcom
#
# This mod uses 2 features which can only be accessed when run with Openxcom Extended (OXCE):
#         * The Avenger has 3 weapon slots, and the Starstreak has 4 weapon slots. Without OXCE you can only equip 2 weapons.
#         * Infiltration missions may be stopped if you defeat UFOs in the final wave. Without OXCE you can only delay missions.
